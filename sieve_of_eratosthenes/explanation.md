The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an ancient algorithm that can help us find all prime numbers up to any given limit.

How does the Sieve of Eratosthenes work?
The following example illustrates how the Sieve of Eratosthenes, can be used to find all the prime numbers that are less than 100.

Step 1: Write the numbers 1 to 100 in ten rows.

Step 2: Cross out 1 because 1 is not a prime.

Step 3: Circle 2 and cross out all multiples of 2. (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ...)

Step 4: Circle 3 and cross out all multiples of 3. (3, 6, 9, 12, 15, ...)

Step 5: Circle 5 and cross out all multiples of 5. (5, 10, 15, 20, ...)

Step 6: Circle 7 and cross out all multiples of 7. (7, 14, 21, 28, ...)

Circle all the numbers that are not crossed out and they are the prime numbers less than 100.
