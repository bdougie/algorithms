You have an array of n integers. Write an algorithm that returns true if the sum of any 3 integers in the array is equal to 0.

Specifics. 1)The array can be of any length 0 to n. 2) You can repeat an integer in the array more than 1 time in your sum.

Example: array = [2, 1, 1] Algorithm returns true, since (-2 + 1 +1) = 0.

Variations: For all your solutions give the run complexity and space complexity.

1) Make the algorithm as fast as possible( decrease the run time in relation to n). 2) Use as little extra memory to find a solution. 3) What if the array was sorted?
